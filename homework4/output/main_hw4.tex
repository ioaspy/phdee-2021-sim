1.Yes, the trends were parallel before treatment and after treatment we notice a drop in pounds of bycatch on treated, which means that the program was efficient.See graph below:
\\
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.7]{graph.eps}
    \caption{Bycatch for control and treated groups by month.}
    \label{fig:samplebars}
\end{figure}

2.The DID equals -8956.78, which mean that bycatch reduces by that amount due the program. So the estimator shows that the program worked.
\\
3.See table \ref{tab:coef_table}:

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \input{coef_table.tex}
    \caption{Sample regression coefficients table with standard errors.}
    \label{tab:coef_table}
\end{table}
\\ 
The result shows that if a firm is treated then bycatch reduces by 4406 pounds which is less than the amount estimated using sample analog on question 2.
